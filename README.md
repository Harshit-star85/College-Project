# College-Project
Develop a console-based application to simulate a simplified library management system. The system will allow librarians (users of the application) to:
●	Add and remove books from the library's collection.
●	Register and deregister users.
●	Facilitate borrowing and returning of books by users.
●	Search for books by various criteria (title, author, ISBN).
●	Display lists of all available books, all registered users, and books currently borrowed by a specific user.
●	Persist library data (books, users, borrowed status) to a file so it's saved between application runs.
